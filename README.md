Boardwalk Games is a modern, responsive web application for a board game café, designed to showcase services, events, and a game library, and to facilitate online reservations. The project demonstrates strong front-end development skills, UI/UX design, and web accessibility best practices.

## Project Overview

Boardwalk Games provides a digital presence for a physical board game café, targeting casual gamers, enthusiasts, and students. The site allows users to:

- Explore the café’s services (play in the café, game library, events, kids parties)
- Browse a curated library of board games (with details and images)
- View upcoming events and tournaments
- Make reservations for tables, events, or specific games
- Contact the café and view opening times

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Fully mobile-friendly layout using Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS.
- **Game Library:** Interactive section showcasing new and favorite games, with images and descriptions.
- **Event Management:** Dynamic event schedule with pricing and student discounts.
- **Booking Forms:** Accessible forms for booking tables, events, or reserving games.
- **Success Feedback:** Confirmation page for successful bookings.
- **Navigation:** Fixed-top navbar with smooth scrolling and collapse on mobile.
- **Contact & Social:** Integrated contact info, opening times, and social media links.
- **Visuals:** Custom branding, favicon, and carousel image galleries.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5:** Semantic markup for accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS3:** Custom styles with CSS variables, Google Fonts, and responsive media queries.
- **Bootstrap 5:** Grid system, cards, forms, and navigation for rapid, consistent UI development.
- **Font Awesome:** Iconography for navigation, contact, and social links.
- **No JavaScript frameworks:** Minimal vanilla JS for navbar behavior; all interactivity is handled with Bootstrap and HTML.
- **Static Assets:** Organized folder structure for images, icons, and styles.

## Accessibility & Best Practices

- Uses semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, footer).
- All forms are accessible and validated.
- Images include descriptive alt text.
- Color contrast and font choices ensure readability.
- Mobile-first design with adaptive layouts.

## Why This Project Stands Out

- **Real-world scenario:** Simulates a business website with practical features.
- **Design polish:** Professional look and feel, with attention to branding and user experience.
- **Code quality:** Clean, well-organized codebase with clear separation of concerns.
- **Recruiter appeal:** Demonstrates front-end proficiency, design sensibility, and understanding of user needs.
